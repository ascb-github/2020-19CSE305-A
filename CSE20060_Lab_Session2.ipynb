       "['So based on the data, the first point what can be inferred is that daily there is some or the other price being recorded. For example on Jun 29 2021, the price was 2081.85/- . Like that from July 2020 to June 2021, the prices are been recorded. By this we can say that the prices are varying day by day and on some days, the price and profit are more whereas on some days the price is less and we get to see that the charge  is in negative values. The future prediction can be done by using the technique of regression and some mathematical formulas based on calculus, statistics, probability etc. Since the values of the price are not discrete, I took the Regression technique which falls under the supervised learning.

      "So based on the data, the first point what can be inferred is that daily there is some or the other price being recorded. For example on Jun 29 2021, the price was 2081.85/- . Like that from July 2020 to June 2021, the prices are been recorded. By this we can say that the prices are varying day by day and on some days, the price and profit are more whereas on some days the price is less and we get to see that the charge  is in negative values. The future prediction can be done by using the technique of regression and some mathematical formulas based on calculus, statistics, probability etc. Since the values of the price are not discrete, I took the Regression technique which falls under the supervised learning. \n",
